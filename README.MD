# liveUmma

## Overview

Welcome to **liveUmma**, a creative coding project that brings the beauty of our solar system to life using Cinder. This project simulates the celestial bodies of our solar system and renders them visually on the screen. The project also aims to include a feature that accurately tracks the time of "salah" (time of prayer) and presents it in a visually captivating manner.

## Features

- Solar System Simulation: Visualize the positions and movements of celestial bodies in our solar system using Cinder.
- Accurate Salah Time Tracker: Track and display the accurate times of Islamic prayers in real-time.
- Utilizing Spice Tool Data: Spice is a tool used for modeling and simulating the dynamics of the solar system. This project incorporates Spice data to enhance the accuracy of the simulation.
- Learning CMake and Ninja: This project serves as a learning opportunity to understand how to use CMake and Ninja for project building and compilation.
- Library Utilization: Gain deeper insights into incorporating libraries and structuring projects to accommodate new features.

## Motivation

The motivation behind **liveUmma** is to:
- Enhance my creative coding skills by creating a visually stunning solar system simulation.
- Develop an accurate and visually appealing Salah time tracking feature for Muslim users.
- Improve my understanding of project organization, CMake, Ninja, and library integration.
- Gain valuable experience in modulating projects to accommodate new functionalities.

## Status

As of now, **liveUmma** is planned to be a desktop application.

## Usage

For usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in the respective folders.

## Contributing
